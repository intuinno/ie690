%	     Example Code 
% -------------------------------------------

This example matlab package:
- Train a two layer stacked convolutional ISA 
  network (optional)
- Run classification on Hollywood2 action 
  recognition dataset.

Instructions: 
----------------------------------------------
- Download this package and unarchive at
  /*yourfolder*/release/

- Download the Hollywood2 actions dataset from
http://pascal.inrialpes.fr/hollywood2/ 

- Scale videos from AVIClips to half size 
  and save in 
  /*yourfolder*/AVIClips05/
  keeping filenames

  (python script resize_videos.py is provided, 
  which assumes installation of ffmpeg)

- Place ClipSets (label information) folder in 
  /*yourfolder*/ClipSets/

- Alow 2~3Gb of space in /*yourfolder*/

----------------[TRAIN]-----------------------
- If you wish to skip, a copy of trained
  bases is given in release/bases/

- Start matlab cd to /*yourfolder*/release/

- Type 

  master_train('/*yourfolder*/AVIClips05/', '/*yourfolder*/release/')

  this might take a few hours to train, depending
  on hardware

----------------[TEST]------------------------
- To test classification on Hollywood2
  modify master_test to change /*yourfolder*/
  at the very top of file. (If you wish to use 
  gpu for computation see [GPU] below.)

  In matlab cd to /*youfolder*/release/
  Type

  master_test

  The default setting (for illustration) uses 
  non-overlap sampling of features. This will 
  run for a few hours to obtain a classification 
  result on Hollywood2

  To obtain better (proper) results, tune up 
  dense sampling parameters, set

  dense_p = 2;
  
  (50% overlap dense sampling) (this setting has 
  a large RAM requirement)

-----------------[GPU]------------------------
In the experiments we used Jacket GPU implementation
for MATLAB, if you have Jacket installed, the code
is enabled for GPU to speed feature extraction.

In master_test.m, addpath to:

/**/jacket/engine 

set:

gpu = 1;

For feature extraction on large amounts of video, 
we were able to significantly speed up computation 
using Jacket's GPU implementation (please 
refer to paper for more details).

------------ OTHER DATASETS -------------
If you'd like to use this code for other datasets,
rename your videos and customize the video folders
 AVIClips05 to contain 
actioncliptrainXXXXX.avi and actioncliptestXXXX.avi
Further, customize the folder ClipSets to contain
a text file for each label, specifying a binary indicator
for each clip, whether that clip contains the action 
label. This setting is identical to the Hollywood2
dataset.

Lastly, customize master files with your desired 
parameters for specific datasets.
