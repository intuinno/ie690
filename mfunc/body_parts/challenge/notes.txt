- for chinese numbers: 11 classes, handshapes
skin detection, face detection, or chamfer distance

- diving signals 1,2,3,4: (9, 10, 10, 9) classes.
motion energy ok, but spotting? perhaps dynamic programming with motion features?

- helicopter: 10 classes, ONLY 9 CLASSES USED, motion

- italian: 11 classes, limited motion

- mudra1: 10 classes, handshapes

- mudra2: 9 classes, handshapes, complex background, no face

- music notes: 8 classes, handshapes

- referee volleyball 1, 2: (9, 8) classes
movement + hold

- surgeon: 9 classes, handshapes

- taxi: 10 classes, some palm motion, some static handshapes

- tractor: 11 classes, motion

notes: in addition to dataset name, functions should take in user and date, perhaps

hand and mirrors are currently ignored

helicopter: 

normalized dtw on normalized skin or motion images

training: compute scores among all models, so that we figure out thresholds.

test: ?

extract_model, gives a sequence of normalized motion images.

full_scores(motion1, motion2)

partial_scores(motion1, motion2) (for spotting)

dataset: 
- training filenames/classes
- test filenames/classes

models:
- class name, features

make_dataset

extract models
compute thresholds
run test
