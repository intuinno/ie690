% The frame is an image, on top of which squares will be drawn to indicate
%     the detected locations.
% The scores are assumed to be detection scores (low scores are good).
% The object size (a matrix [height, width]) defines the size of the 
%     rectangle that will be drawn, centered on each result.
% The suppression factor indicates the number of neighboring pixels to
%     suppress around each detection. A factor of 1 corresponds to
%     suppressing all locations within the bounding box of each detected
%     location. A factor of 0.5 means that the length of the sides of the 
%     box containing the suppressed locations will be half the length
%     of the sides of the bounding box of the detection.
