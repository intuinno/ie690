This directory contains image alignment annotations for the development sets devel01 to devel20.
The file image_alignment.mat contains the annotations in Matlab format.
The annotations are also available in CSV format from image_alignment.csv.

To look at a random subset of files, a Matlab program is available: 
>> alignment_test('image_alignment', data_dir);
where data_dir is a directory containing the development batches devel01 to devel20.

Matlab format:
=============
There are 2 structures in the image_alignment.mat file, of dimentions the number of frames annotated:

==> alignment_annotation: contains transformation variables with respect to an origin in the upper left corner
	struct alignment_annotation {
		translate_x;
		translate_y;
		scale_x;
		scale_y;
	}
See LOOK_AT_ME.jpg for an interpretation of the parameters.
	
==> alignment_labels: contains frame origin information	struct labels {
		dataset_name % the batch name
		videos       % the movie number in the batch (1 to 47)
		frame        % the frame number in the movie
	}
	
	For example, if alignment_labels(5) = struct( 'dataset_name', 'devel09', 'videos', 11, 'frame', 21)
	It states that in alignment_annotation(5), the translation coordinated were obtained for devel09/K_11, frame#21
	
	So far, there're 260 frames annotated

CSV format:
==========
Each line in the matrix corresponds to a frame. The columns correspond to:
dataset_name -- one of the batches devel01 through devel20
videos       -- movie number in a batch (1-47)   
frame        -- frame number in the video
translate_x  -- x translation
translate_y  -- y translation
scale_x      -- x scaling
scale_y      -- y scaling
